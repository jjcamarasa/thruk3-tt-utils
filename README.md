### change-thruk-icon-font.sh
Simple bash script that performs the correlation between fontawesome names and unicons and changes it in .tt files. Uses a simple csv text file _icons-names-fa-need-translate.txt_ and bash string manipulation.
No need to say that you must make a backup of your original files dir before proceeding.
Change paths at top of the script.
